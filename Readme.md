# Generic API .net 5

>>> (This Generic API is created out of the original version from 
https://github.com/matjazmav/generic-api)

Basic application is a default web-api project in VS. I left everything in it. 

The generic repository is changed with a more worked-out version. 


In GenericController a specific funtion is added. This Shows you how to have that function available from every repository.

To show you how to extend a specific repository with a function, PostController is added. 


Hope it will helps you create your own. 

Good luke with this code example.
