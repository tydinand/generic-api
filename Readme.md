# Generic API .net 5

###### This Generic API is created out of the original version from https://github.com/matjazmav/generic-api

*The basic application is a default web-api project in VS. I left everything in it.*

>- The generic repository is changed with a more worked-out version. 

>- GenricController as a function GetPosts. 
This specific funtion is now available on all repositories.

>- Added post controller to show how to can extend one (post) repository with specific funtions. 

 	
Good luke with this code example.
