# Generic API .net 5

This Generic API is created out of the original version from 
https://github.com/matjazmav/generic-api

The basic application is a default web-api project in VS. I left everything in it. 

The generic repository is changed with a more worked-out version. 

I added a post controller to show how you can extend the GenericController with specific funtions. 

Good luke with this code example.
